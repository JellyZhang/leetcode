#### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

> Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: "abcabcbb"
> Output: 3 
> Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: "bbbbb"
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: "pwwkew"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
>           Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

Sliding window.

when sliding, check whether s[j] has shown in s[i~j]. if so, then move i to (the pos of previous j)-1

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_set<char> mp;
        int i = 0, j = 0, n = s.size(), ans = 0;
        while(j < n){
            if(!mp.count(s[j])){
                ans = max(ans, j-i+1);
                mp.insert(s[j]);
                j++;
            }else{
                mp.erase(s[i]);
                i++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
