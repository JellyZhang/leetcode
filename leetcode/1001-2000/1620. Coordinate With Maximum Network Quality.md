> You are given an array of network towers `towers` and an integer `radius`, where `towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi]` denotes the `ith` network tower with location `(xi, yi)` and quality factor `qi`. All the coordinates are **integral coordinates** on the X-Y plane, and the distance between two coordinates is the **Euclidean distance**.
>
> The integer `radius` denotes the **maximum distance** in which the tower is **reachable**. The tower is **reachable** if the distance is less than or equal to `radius`. Outside that distance, the signal becomes garbled, and the tower is **not reachable**.
>
> The signal quality of the `ith` tower at a coordinate `(x, y)` is calculated with the formula `⌊qi / (1 + d)⌋`, where `d` is the distance between the tower and the coordinate. The **network quality** at a coordinate is the sum of the signal qualities from all the **reachable** towers.
>
> Return *the integral coordinate where the **network quality** is maximum*. If there are multiple coordinates with the same **network quality**, return *the lexicographically minimum coordinate*.
>
> **Note:**
>
> - A coordinate `(x1, y1)` is lexicographically smaller than `(x2, y2)` if either `x1 < x2` or `x1 == x2` and `y1 < y2`.
> - `⌊val⌋` is the greatest integer less than or equal to `val` (the floor function).

> Explanation: 
> At coordinate (2, 1) the total quality is 13
> - Quality of 7 from (2, 1) results in ⌊7 / (1 + sqrt(0)⌋ = ⌊7⌋ = 7
> - Quality of 5 from (1, 2) results in ⌊5 / (1 + sqrt(2)⌋ = ⌊2.07⌋ = 2
> - Quality of 9 from (3, 1) results in ⌊9 / (1 + sqrt(1)⌋ = ⌊4.5⌋ = 4
> No other coordinate has higher quality.

> ```
> Input: towers = [[2,1,9],[0,1,9]], radius = 2
