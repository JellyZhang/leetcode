> Given `n` points on a 1-D plane, where the `ith` point (from `0` to `n-1`) is at `x = i`, find the number of ways we can draw **exactly** `k` **non-overlapping** line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have **integral coordinates**. The `k` line segments **do not** have to cover all `n` points, and they are **allowed** to share endpoints.
>
> Return *the number of ways we can draw* `k` *non-overlapping line segments**.* Since this number can be huge, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSets(int n, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> a(n+1, vector<int>(k+1, 0));
        vector<vector<int>> b(n+1, vector<int>(k+1, 0));
        const int MOD=1e9+7;
        n--;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;++i){
            for(int j=1;j<=i && j<=k;++j){
                if(j == 1){
                    a[i][j] = i;
                    b[i][j] = i*(i-1)/2;
                }else{
                    a[i][j] = (a[i-1][j] + b[i][j-1])%MOD;
                    b[i][j] = (a[i-1][j] + b[i-1][j])%MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        return (a[n][k] + b[n][k])%MOD;
    }
};
```

We create 2 arrays:
A\[i\]\[j\] ==> the number of ways when there are total **i** segments and we draw **j** lines and **i-th segment is picked.**
B\[i\]\[j\] ==> the number of ways when there are total **i** segments and we draw **j** lines and **i-th segment not picked.**

```
A[i][j]  = A[i-1][j] ( we use the leading  i-1 segaments to draw j lines, and attach the last segment to the last line)
		 + B[i][j-1] ( we use the total i segaments to draw j-1 lines and left i-th segment empty, then we pick i-th segment and draw it as j-th line, so we get j lines);
```
```
B[i][j] = A[i-1][j] ( we use the leading i-1 segments to draw j lines, and just leave i-th segment empty)
		+ B[i-1][j] ( we use the leading i-1 segments to draw j lines, and just leave i-th segment empty)

```

In addition, we have to calculate the init statements for A and B.
```
A[1][1] = 1,
A[2][1] = 2,
A[3][1] = 3,
...
we can get A[i][1] = i.
```

```
B[i][1] = A[i-1][1] + B[i-1][1]
		= A[i-1][1] + A[i-2][1] + B[i-2][1]
		= ...
		= i-1 + i-2 + i-3 +... + 1
		= i*(i-1)/2
```
