> Design a Skiplist without using any built-in libraries.

> *A Skiplist is a data structure that takes O(log(n)) time to `add`, `erase` and `search`. Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists are just simple linked lists.*
>
> *For example: we have a Skiplist containing `[30,40,50,60,70,90]` and we want to add `80` and `45` into it. The Skiplist works this way:*

> *You can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, `add` , `erase` and `search `can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).*

> To be specific, your design should include these functions:
>
> - `bool search(int target)` : Return whether the `target` exists in the Skiplist or not.
> - `void add(int num)`: Insert a value into the SkipList. 
> - `bool erase(int num)`: Remove a value in the Skiplist. If `num` does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exists multiple `num` values, removing any one of them is fine.

> Note that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.

> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Skiplist skiplist = new Skiplist();
> 
> skiplist.add(1);
> skiplist.add(2);
> skiplist.add(3);
> skiplist.search(0);   // return false.
> skiplist.add(4);
> skiplist.search(1);   // return true.
> skiplist.erase(0);    // return false, 0 is not in skiplist.
> skiplist.erase(1);    // return true.
> skiplist.search(1);   // return false, 1 has already been erased.

> **Constraints:**

> - `0 <= num, target <= 20000`
> - At most `50000` calls will be made to `search`, `add`, and `erase`.

- Insert:
  - find every layer's rightmost node that less than target.
  - from bottom up, 1/2 chance to grow.
  - if we connect every rightmost node and still growing, we should create a new layer, and a new headNode.
- search:
  - find every layer's rightmost node that less than target.
  - check his right is target or not.
- erase:
  - PS: target node's height may not be the total height, So we use a "seen" value to record that we see target num or not.
  - if we have seen target num in out right, then we should skip it for every rightmost node.
  - if we have not seen it, then dig down to find it.
