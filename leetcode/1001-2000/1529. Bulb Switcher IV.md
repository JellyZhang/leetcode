> There is a room with `n` bulbs, numbered from `0` to `n-1`, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially all the bulbs are **turned off**.
>
> Your task is to obtain the configuration represented by `target` where `target[i]` is '1' if the i-th bulb is turned on and is '0' if it is turned off.
>
> You have a switch to flip the state of the bulb, a flip operation is defined as follows:
>
> - Choose **any** bulb (index `i`) of your current configuration.
> - Flip each bulb from index `i` to `n-1`.
>
> When any bulb is flipped it means that if it is 0 it changes to 1 and if it is 1 it changes to 0.
>
> Return the **minimum** number of flips required to form `target`.

> Input: target = "10111"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Initial configuration "00000".
> flip from the third bulb:  "00000" -> "00111"
> flip from the first bulb:  "00111" -> "11000"
> flip from the second bulb:  "11000" -> "10111"
> We need at least 3 flip operations to form target.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(string target) {
        int ans = 0;
        char prev = '0';
        for(char ch:target){
            if(ch != prev){
                prev = ch;
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

观察可发现

- 每次flip的先后顺序不会影响。
- 1可视为被翻了odd次，0视为翻了even次。
- 右侧的被翻次数肯定大于等于左侧。

因此从最左开始贪心地取最小被翻次数。如果与左侧的灯泡奇偶性不同，则认定在这里翻了一次。
