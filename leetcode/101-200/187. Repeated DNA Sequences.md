```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
        unordered_map<string, int> showed;
        int n = s.size();
        if(n <= 10) return {};
        string cur = s.substr(0, 10);
        showed[cur] = 1;
        vector<string> ans;
        for(int i=10;i<n;++i){
            cur.erase(cur.begin());
            cur.push_back(s[i]);
            if(showed[cur] == 1){
                ans.push_back(cur);
            }
            showed[cur]++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

PS: `"AAAAAAAAAAAA"`should return `"AAAAAAAAAA"`

which means ans should not contain duplicates.
