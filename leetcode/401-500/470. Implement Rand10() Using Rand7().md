> Given the **API** `rand7()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 7]`, write a function `rand10()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range `[1, 10]`. You can only call the API `rand7()`, and you shouldn't call any other API. Please **do not** use a language's built-in random API.
>
> Each test case will have one **internal** argument `n`, the number of times that your implemented function `rand10()` will be called while testing. Note that this is **not an argument** passed to `rand10()`.
>
> **Follow up:**
>
> - What is the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) for the number of calls to `rand7()` function?
> - Could you minimize the number of calls to `rand7()`?

```cpp
// The rand7() API is already defined for you.
// int rand7();https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-rand10-using-rand7/discuss/
// @return a random integer in the range 1 to 7

class Solution {
public:
    int rand10() {
        int x = (rand7()-1)*7 + rand7()-1;
        while(x > 39){
            x = (rand7()-1)*7 + rand7()-1;
        }
        return x % 10 + 1;
    }
};
```

Assume m = rand7 -1 , m is [0,6]

7*m = 0,7,14,...,42

7*m + m =[0,6], [7,13],[14,20]...[42, 48]

we can know the leading 40 elements have the same possibilities. so we take first 40 elements, which is [0, 39]
