```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if(n <= 1) return 0;
        if(n == 2) return max(0, prices[1] - prices[0]);
        vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);
        int temp = INT_MIN;
        for(int i=0;i<n;++i){
            if(i == 0){
                dp[i] = 0;
                temp = max(temp, -prices[0]);
            }else if(i == 1){
                dp[i] = max(0, prices[1] - prices[0]);
                temp = max(temp, -prices[1]);
            }else{
                dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], temp + prices[i]);
                temp = max(temp, dp[i-2] - prices[i]);
            }
        }
        return dp[n-1];
    }
};
```

dp[i] ===> 前i天最大收益

dp[i] = dp[i-1] 

 or prices[i] （卖出i股票） + max of ( dp[j-2] - prices[j] ）0<=j<i，假设之前在j天买入的，那么在买入前肯定要cooldown一下，因此用dp[j-2]
