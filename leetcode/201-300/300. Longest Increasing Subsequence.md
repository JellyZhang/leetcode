```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> t;
        for(int num:nums){
            auto pos = lower_bound(t.begin(), t.end(), num);
            if(pos == t.end()){
                t.push_back(num);
            }else{
                *pos = num;
            }
        }
        return t.size();
    }
};
```

对于t(i)来说，t(i) = 形成长度为i+1的上升子序列时末尾最小的值。

t(i) = the min of the tail of increasing subsequence of length = i+1.
